        <img src="country.jpg" alt="A picture representing my state or country">
        <p>Ghana, located in West Africa, is known for its rich history, diverse culture, and warm hospitality. As the first African nation to gain independence from colonial rule in 1957, Ghana has played a significant role in the continent’s history. The country boasts beautiful landscapes, from the sandy beaches along the Gulf of Guinea to lush rainforests and wildlife-filled national parks. Ghana is also famous for its vibrant festivals, traditional kente cloth, and delicious cuisine, including jollof rice and fufu. The capital city, Accra, is a bustling hub of modern development, while historical sites like Cape Coast Castle serve as reminders of its past.</p>
